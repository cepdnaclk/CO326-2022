<h2>Lab 3 - Data Acquisition (DAQ)</h2>

### Introduction

In this remote lab, you need to configure a DAQ card to do the following tasks:

- Read the analog value of the pin, **AI5** (It is connected to an LDR, and a non-zero value will be shown as the ADC reading)
- Read the digital value of the pin, **P0.0** (the value can be controlled by the slider switch in the right-side panel of this page)
- Write a digital value into the pin, **P0.1** (The results can be seen through the camera feed)

### Task

You need to prepare the lab setup described above using the *LabView* software and make a screen recording with explanation (not greater than 5 mins), which is clearly showing the functionality of the implementation. You can decide on the ranges, the display components etc...

The video should be submitted as a **zip file**, named as *"CO326_lab03_GroupXX.zip"*, where *XX* is your group number. One submission from a group is significant.

Hint: You can use a screen recording software like *[Screen Recorder Pro](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/screen-recorder-pro-for-win10/9n27gq6mls5s)* to record the demonstration.

Once you completed the lab, please make sure to update the Google Sheet, [CO326 Lab03 Completion](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YOwtUlmdOONxOYvDJwIcPrCFjXHm1ofozjH0hQ4CAas/edit?usp=sharing)

### Note

Please make sure to delete your lab codes from the remote machine before logging out from the *Team Viewer* session.
